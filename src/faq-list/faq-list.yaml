  - question: "Why an indefinite strike?"
    answer: "According to various political sources, an inactive workforce would cripple the economy. We aim to do just that - bring corporations and employers to a point of discomfort that forces them to acknowledge our demands. The May Day Strike has no pre-determined end date. The strike ends when our demands have been met."

  - question: "Why May 1st?"
    answer: ""
    unorderedListItem1: "International Workers' Day - May 1st is International Workers' Day (Labor Day). Learn the history of May Day below."
    unorderedListItem2: "Preparation - A strike lasting ten days or longer will inevitably require financial preparation for all participants. Such advance notice provides ample time to accrue savings, stockpile food, etc."
    unorderedListItem3: "Allowing time for changes in employer policy - For employers who are currently unaware of the need for reform, this period of 3+ months will allow time for wage and benefit adjustments. As the movement gains momentum, it is likely some employers will begin to take preemptive measures such as improving work conditions and wages."
    unorderedListItem4: "Time for Organization and planning - As a grassroots movement, the May Day Strike will take time to organize on an international level. Between this moment and May 1st, we will have ample time to plan and prepare the movement for what comes next."
